Use Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback for fine tuning an LLM model.





Here is the updated README with the added information:

**RLHF Fine-Tuning Loop for LLMs**

Our Large Language Model (LLM) is fine-tuned using a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) loop. The loop consists of the following steps:

1. **Preference Dataset**: A dataset of human preferences is collected, which serves as the foundation for the fine-tuning process.
2. **Unsupervised Training (Reward Model)**: The preference dataset is used to train a reward model in an unsupervised manner. This reward model will be used to provide feedback to the LLM during the reinforcement learning loop.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Training Loop**: The base LLM is then trained using reinforcement learning, with the reward model providing feedback on its performance. The LLM is updated based on this feedback, and the process is repeated until convergence.

Here is a high-level illustration of the RLHF fine-tuning loop:

    B -->|provides feedback|> C[Reinforcement Learning Training Loop]
    C -->|updates LLM|> D[Base LLM]
    D -->|converges|> E[Fine-tuned LLM]
```
Note that this is a simplified representation of the RLHF fine-tuning loop, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and architecture of the LLM.
